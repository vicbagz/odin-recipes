            A fun chicken recipe the kids can help prepare. They love crushing the crackers. It does not matter if the measurements aren't perfect, just wing it!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
